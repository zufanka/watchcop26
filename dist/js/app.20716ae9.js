Climate change is impacting all of us, but the severest and most immediate impacts are already being felt by the most vulnerable. The event will focus on the challenges facing women in the transition to a green economy. We will explore, among other areas, the issue of energy. As COP President, Alok Sharma, has said, “the clean energy transition is central to tackling climate change”. Clean energy is also an important driver of social impact and a lever for empowering women. Join us to learn from the latest thinking on empowering women through a green transition, with practical examples from leading businesses and practitioners. Take actionable insights back into your organisation and deepen your understanding of how your organisation can increase the impact and effectiveness of its efforts to address climate change and empower women, through partnerships between business, government and civil society. Clean energy is key to increasing energy access for rural communities in Africa - with direct benefits for people\'s lives, livelihoods, and learning. African rural women and girls are the most impacted by a lack of access to energy, and evidence suggests that COVID-19 has made this situation worse. Clean energy also provides opportunities for women entrepreneurs - such as building and selling solar lamps and installing and maintaining solar panels. This can help build their economic resilience, and break barriers by placing women at the forefront of innovative technology and sustainable energy, helping to close the gender gap in STEM, and ensuring women in rural communities are included in the green economy. This event is hosted by Business Fights Poverty, a business-led collaboration network focused on social impact, in partnership with The Corporate Responsibility Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School and The Green Girls Organisation, an NGO that empowers women to provide renewable energy to rural communities.","panel":"panel","film":null},{"ID":"S002","Text":"Climate and the Deep Sea World: Schmidt Ocean Institute’s Global Efforts – A Visual Journey and Panel","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oSpk1eSWMs","views":4600,"organizer":"Schmidt Ocean Institute","description":"The backdrop of legends and movies, the deep sea has always been unfathomable because we had no idea what existed there. Once thought to be barren of life, we now know this couldn’t be further from the truth. Life exists under extreme conditions at these depths and with every deep-sea expedition we gain a greater understanding of the crucial services it provides our planet. Although seemingly remote, the deep sea plays a key role in our climate. Better understanding of remote and deep-sea biodiversity, offers insight into how these systems both influence the climate and are, in turn, influenced by climate change. These insights are made with the help of new technologies such as Schmidt Ocean Institute’s 4,500 meter capable underwater robot, ROV SuBastian.

Running over human rights, profound impacts on biodiversity and traditional communities, violation of international laws and agreements and allegations of widespread corruption are some of the examples that have been observed about the construction of hydroelectric plants in the region. In addition to all these problems, Hydroelectric power plants installed in tropical forest areas emit considerable amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of the degradation of flooded vegetation and soil. With all these impacts on the scale, it is impossible to classify hydroelectric as clean energy. The Brazilian Indigenous people have denounced the impacts and risks in their areas, yet these same communities are often generating innovative, just, and scalable clean energy solutions. This session is an invitation to hear from the front lines about the social, environmental and economic impacts of hydropower dams, that are being falsely portrayed as “clean and renewable” energy and a solution to the climate crisis.

Join us for an interactive, inspirational session on getting the social side of sustainable transport right. Transport emissions are rising faster globally than any other sector. While a shift to cleaner vehicles is important, it will take decades to take effect. To achieve meaningful change quickly, we must shift reliance away from private cars, making public and community transport, walking, cycling and shared mobility the ‘natural choice’. Research shows the social side of this change is vital: creating place-based solutions, integrating low-carbon modes, and encouraging and enabling sustainable transport behaviours. The Sustainable Transport Alliance is the UK’s leading partnership of NGOs advocating for healthy, low carbon transport. This session will draw on our networks to showcase practical examples and insights on how local initiatives can engage and empower communities to achieve climate-safe, inclusive, healthy transport systems and behaviours. Our panel of government, academic, industry and community experts will look at what broader policy and funding support is required to facilitate these initiatives; share expertise on building trust and making change last; and consider the wider impact on climate goals and additional benefits for health, wellbeing and sustainable development. These lessons are adaptable to any local context. This event will include colourful examples that paint an inspiring picture of pathways to clean, green, equitable travel.

Cities across the world are wringing their hands in morbid concern. But rarely does the action match the rhetoric. The North West of England is different. It is a region with innovation and change in its DNA. From the industrial revolution of the 1800\'s to the cultural revolution of the 1960\'s, from Andre Geim to John Lennon, this is a place which drives change through action. Our response to the Climate Crisis follows this same path. A response which is about doing things not just talking about them. About knowing that there is no silver bullet, but that progress is more important than perfection. But too often the path to progress is pitched as an inter-generational battle. The unchanging Old v The progressive Young. This is far from the case. Hosted by Paul Mason, broadcaster and journalist ‘Talking About Our Generation’ will bring North West Metro Mayors, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham together with the innovators who have driven change over the past generation and those who are set to take on that mantle in the crucial decades to come. Open and honest, these conversations offer a chance for reflection and curiosity, to remember what has been achieved and what is still in the ‘too hard to do’ pile. They will break down the idea that the crisis we face is born from a generational divide and show it as a shared human endeavour. This is the moment when together we must lay the foundations of a new world. For the young people of the North West this is not a nice to have, This is our Climate Future.

Most of Inuit Nunaat already has an infrastructure deficit that connects to climate resilience and adaptive capacity. For example: • Education: Most Inuit must travel far from home for post-secondary education. • Power: Many Inuit communities are reliant on diesel generators to provide power. • Housing: Lack of sufficient housing is chronic in Inuit communities. In 2017, there were almost 900 people in Greenland with no permanent housing. • Marine infrastructure: Inuit are coastal people and rely on marine resources. With an Arctic Ocean open for more of the year, the seas present opportunities for traditional harvesting pursuits, and other opportunities from increased shipping access. But this require appropriate infrastructure that is currently sparse in Inuit Nunaat. Climate change is a challenge to the integrity of various aspects of our community infrastructure. In Alaska, whole Inuit communities are threatened, as big storms are no longer buffered by protective shore ice. In other communities, there are concerns about the integrity of roads, pipelines, water and sewer pipes, and runways.

There is no end to the climate crisis without stopping tropical deforestation. Our forests are our key ally if we’re to keep to our climate goals. In 2020 the tropics lost 12.2 million hectares of forest cover. Of that 4.2 million hectares, an area the size of the Netherlands, occurred within humid tropical primary forests, which are hotspots for biodiversity, home to indigenous communities and vital in halting climate breakdown. For many years Global Witness and Global Canopy have exposed the international demand for commodities - soy, beef, palm oil and timber - that are driving this destruction and the human and environmental abuses that go alongside it. The financial sector plays a key role in this global trade and must now work closely with the guardians for the forest who are Indigenous Peoples. Our event will put policy makers, financial leaders, and Indigenous communities in one room, exploring the problem and coming up with solutions.

With 1% of pension savings across the 37 OECD countries representing US $320 billion, there is great potential for pension schemes to capitalise upon investment opportunities that have positive impact and drive the transition to a net-zero economy while making a financial return. The shift to a net-zero carbon economy will have practical consequences on people and communities, for example, job losses in some sectors, and growth opportunities and new skills required in others. This is one reason why the transition to net-zero needs to be a just transition, considering the social impacts of tackling climate change. The Impact Investing Institute has developed four Impact Investing Principles for Pensions, which provide practical guidelines on how pensions can pursue an investing strategy that can contribute to delivering a just transition, and how pension trustees, advisors, fiduciary managers and asset managers can adopt a ‘transitional mindset’ – considering the risks and opportunities within their portfolio presented by the transition to a more sustainable world. The Principles have been adopted by a number of pension schemes and investment consultants and are supported by key industry bodies. Join the Impact Investing Institute and hear from a range of voices in the industry who will share the investment opportunities and case studies presented by adopting a just transition investing approach, the advantages for institutional investors, such as pensions funds, in adopting a transitional mindset and how that can help to build socially and environmentally resilient economies in the future.","panel":"panel","film":null},{"ID":"S058","Text":"“Global Youth Energy Outlook Launch: Effectively partnering with youth on climate action”","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1GBoiQHEy4","views":1100,"organizer":"Student Energy","description":"Join Student Energy for the launch of the inaugural Global Youth Energy Outlook report.

Nils Sandman explains what climate nudges are and introduces the Nudging for Climate research project. The project investigates the viability of nudges to help communities move to climate-friendly transport, and to fortify forests as carbon sinks. Professor Till Grüne-Yanoff discusses different types of behavioural policy interventions, especially nudges and boosts. Nudges harness existing biases, while boosts foster competences. This has important implications for their effectiveness, persistence and spill-over effects, as well as for their moral acceptability. Grüne-Yanoff describes an experimental design to test these implications for energy conservation in a Swedish student dormitory. Professor Kai Ruggeri discusses economic inequality, which is a major complication for addressing individual behaviour when it comes to climate change. In short, some green choices are a realistic choice only for healthy and wealthy people, whereas other green policies may backfire for low-income groups. Ruggeri discusses how to address this complication in future climate policy. Polaris Koi explores whether behavioural insights can help resolve climate change as a problem of global collective action. Behavioural policy has traditionally focused on the local impacts of the policy, but the climate crisis requires a global perspective that goes beyond interventions in the Global North and addresses geographic differences in world health, wealth, and education.","panel":"panel","film":null},{"ID":"S139","Text":"Addressing Migration Driven by Disasters, Climate Change and Environmental Degradation in West Africa","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7e5oINwhlw","views":1100,"organizer":"IOM","description":"Brief background: In West Africa, population movements have always been linked to the environment, be it in form of displacement in the context of disasters, transhumance or longer-term labour migration in the context of agricultural activities. Over the last decades, the adverse effects of climate change have intensified environmental events and processes in the region, such as droughts, desertification, water scarcity, rising sea levels, coastal erosion and flooding, compelling more people directly and indirectly to leave their homes. States have made commitments in the GCM to address these dynamics in Objectives 2 and 5, and the Paris Agreement together with the Recommendations of the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement call for addressing these trends. Side event objectives:  Raise awareness of the links between migration, displacement, planned relocation and disasters, climate change and environmental degradation in West Africa. Demonstrate how partnerships contribute to facilitating pathways for regular migration and minimizing displacement in the context of climate change, environmental degradation and disasters in line with the guiding principles and commitments of States in the GCM, especially Objectives 2 and 5, and the Paris Agreement and the recommendations of the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement. Highlight solutions for people compelled to move in the context of disasters, climate change and environmental degradation in West Africa.

They capture and store carbon dioxide - coastal blue carbon - and they do this at rates far greater than most tropical rainforests. Protecting and restoring mangroves is a highly efficient and effective way to simultaneously reduce GHG emissions, and supporting adaptation to climate change . Mangrove protection and restoration is a vital component of achieving the large-scale carbon drawdown essential if we are to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Coastal tropical nations and their citizens hold the key to mangrove conservation and restoration. This panel will bring together governments, civil society and world renowned scientists from Colombia, Madagascar, Costa Rica, Seychelles and Indonesia for an interactive discussion that will promote south-south knowledge sharing by:  Bringing to light the importance of mangroves in the context of global climate breakdown, from the perspective of coastal communities living on the frontline and governments working to ensure their countries’ blue economies are safeguarded Demonstrating how the conservation and restoration of coastal blue carbon can help ensure that countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement are sufficiently ambitious to tackle the climate emergency Explaining how, if the necessary policy and safeguarding frameworks are in place, carbon markets can be leveraged to fund and incentivise sustainable mangrove management and restoration Highlighting some of the policy and implementation barriers that must be tackled if mangrove blue carbon is to reach its full potential, as well as some potential solutions to these barriers The panel discussion will be supplemented by mixed media and interactive audience Q&A.","panel":"panel","film":null},{"ID":"S133","Text":"Combining Indigenous Knowledge and Technology to act on the Climate Emergency","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdDWpbrNFhQ","views":1000,"organizer":"World Habitat","description":"Mountainous regions are disproportionately affected by the climate emergency.

With over 128 million electric vehicles to be sold annually by 2041 this could create a huge problem, unless there is another way. Over the past four years, Advanced Electric Machines (AEM) has been working with world-class academics, global vehicle manufacturers and leading industrial partners to deliver the most sustainable and highest performing solutions for electric vehicles, from passenger cars and trucks to tractors and aerospace. AEM has manufactured a range of electric motors for these sectors that allow our customers to go faster and travel further, whilst remaining much greener than other technologies due to our elimination of environmentally damaging primary rare earth materials. We also remove copper, which means our motors are fully recyclable at end-of-life. However, we haven’t stopped there. AEM brings together partners from across the UK to collaborate on government-funded projects to develop this technology even further. From creating high-power, e-axle systems with Bentley Motors for their world-renowned luxury cars, to delivering breakthrough integrated solutions for the next-generation of electrified commercial vehicles with Tevva. AEM is even working alongside Hypromag to extract, recycle and reuse rare earth magnets that have already been disposed of to power our world record-holding aerospace technology.

Faith-based actors are an integral part of crisis-affected communities, and are present before, during and after a climate induced crisis. What role does the faith perspective play, and what is needed to allow and spur faith actors to be a positive force for ensuring gender and climate justice? The needed agreements, principles and plans are already in place. These include the Gender Action Plan adopted at COP25, and the Principles of locally-led adaptation formulated by World Resources Institute (WRI) and International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), to which Islamic Relief and Act Church of Sweden were among the first signatories. Faith is a frame of values, ethics, attitudes and behaviours which is an important foundation for understanding and assessing climate action and societal transformation. However, progress is slow and climate finance is lacking. It is high time to transform words into action. During this event, arranged by Islamic Relief Sweden in collaboration with Act Church of Sweden, we will share examples of climate adaptation from local contexts and listen to the experience of communities affected by climate change. A panel of experts, including representatives of faith-based organisations, will provide comment on current efforts to transform policies into action. We will discuss the interconnections between locally-led climate adaptation, gender-responsive programming and faith, and what can be done by faith actors and others to put affected people at the centre of discussions on adaptation, inclusive decision-making and accountability. Drawing on the inter-religious statement “Sacred People, Sacred Earth”, we will explore what can be done by faith actors and the international community to ensure that faith becomes a catalytic force for climate- and gender justice for crisis-affected people and communities.

Speakers from national governments, including transport ministers, from international organisations, labour organisations, foundations and industry will share their commitments and goals in achieving gender equality through transport and climate measures. The event will also present initiatives and policies that capture the synergies between climate and gender equality goals in the transport sector.  Transport is not gender neutral. Women’s travel behaviour is often not taken into consideration in the design of infrastructure and services. Future low- or zero-carbon mobility options must recognise women’s needs to avoid further gender gaps. As women are exhibiting more sustainable travel behaviour than men, e.g. walking and using public transport more than driving, women are at the center of transforming transport. The Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women. It has limited their mobility options and forced them to change their travel behaviour. But the global pandemic crisis has also created a window of opportunity for seeking more sustainable, inclusive and resilient models of economic growth and transport activity. A number of countries are developing sustainable recovery measures as a central part of stimulus packages and many of these also include sustainable transport.  Raised climate ambitions for transport are spawning new commitments and the development of recovery pathways. Women must be part of these discussions as main drivers of change. They must lead the way towards transport services that are attractive to women and in promoting a more gender-balanced transport workforce. Increasing the representation and visibility of women at all stages of transport policy, planning, implementation, and usage of transport projects will make transport more responsive to the needs of all users and increase the sustainability of transport development.

In the past, this potential has often gone untapped, but this is changing as evidenced by the inclusion of culture-bases strategies in the updated Marrakesh Partnership Resilience Pathway and the new Race to Resilience. This event will build on these advances to inspire even greater mobilisation on from cultural actors, while also introducing those working in other fields of climate action to the benefits of partnering with cultural institutions, advocates and organisations. Framing resilience narratives in the history of communities builds confidence born of the knowledge that past uncertainties were successfully met, while rooting resilience measures in existing community action, culture, heritage and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and local communities helps assure more effective and durable outcomes. Arts, culture and heritage can bring inclusive and people-centred approaches that support locally-led resilience work and help centre equity. This event will feature local examples drawn from diverse voices and contexts, including food & agricultural, buildings and cities and coasts and oceans.

We are bringing together a committee of real people; 21 st century heroes of all races, ages, genders and species, and with an emphasis on the working classes, to represent the planet and its diverse mix of people and other species. Young and old will be welcome to share their stories, their struggles, their hopes and dreams. Our heroes – people from all walks of life - face a huge problem; a broken society and a devastated planet and they are the ones who will suffer the most. Not only that, but they have one thing in common - they have been powerless for too long. Overwhelmed by the scale of the climate emergency combined with sometimes living on the fringes of society, they haven’t had a voice…until now. The Voiceless Revolution is a coming together of the disenfranchised, the marginalised and the unrepresented. Whilst the greatest minds on the planet - governments, business leaders and entrepreneurs – have been trying in vain to solve the problem, there is still much to do and not much time in which to do it. We now need to listen to the planet, to marginalised communities, to all species. We need to collaborate at every step of the way and we need to listen and learn from each other. The Voiceless Revolution will ensure that everyone is listened to. The backbone of the world, of industry, of life is ready to take centre stage. The grafters, the creators, the refugees, the cleaners, the sweepers, the homeless, the machinists, the miners, the care experienced, the child birthers, the taxi drivers, the lions, the worker bees, the companion dogs. We are bringing them all to the conversation and through a mix of discussion, film, the arts and a huge positive call to action, we aim to ensure that everybody, who is being impacted or will be impacted by the climate emergency, is included. This is humanity, and other species, at their finest. It’s time for drastic measures. It’s time to listen to the voiceless.

It impedes the realisation of children’s fundamental rights as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The unfolding climate crisis compounds existing social and economic inequalities both within and between countries, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable children and their caregivers, particularly those living in urban slums and informal settlements, in fragile and developing contexts. Despite being at the forefront of inter-related crises in cities, children and youth, especially the most marginalised, face discrimination and exclusion from decision-making processes in urban and transport planning, climate change mitigation, and local governance, and lack direct representation of their needs. Yet, when children and youth actively participate, they catalyse positive change in the spaces in which they live, learn, work and play, contributing to better cities for all. The Global Alliance – Cities 4 Children is a unique coalition of organisations working across health, nutrition, climate change, road safety, air quality, migration, urban design and child and youth participation. The Global Alliance has the privilege to work with inspiring children and young people from around the world who are taking climate action and advocating for the populations most affected by the climate crisis. Join this interactive and intergenerational dialogue, chaired by the former Guardian Cities editor Chris Michael, to hear from children, youth, mayors, practitioners and organisations focused on child wellbeing in cities, on their experiences, solutions and replicable projects to tackle the climate emergency.

We know that many of the root causes of climate change contribute to gender inequality which can lead to girls being out of school - this year alone, at least four million girls won\'t complete their education due to climate-related crises (Malala Fund). Gender inequality also blocks girls from equal access to quality climate education, green jobs, leadership opportunities etc. Through the Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action (2019), the MOCK COP26 Treaty (2020), youth activists have made it clear that education plays a critical role during climate disasters and displacement. It is also one of the most effective solutions we have to the climate crisis. Existing research reveals that every additional year of schooling for girls leads to significant improvements in a country’s resilience to climate-related disasters. Yet existing commitments on climate education fall far short on delivering quality climate education - curricula are outdated and girls being left behind. In a recent survey, 82% didn’t know where to find information on the Paris Agreement and only 16% had learned about the gendered impacts of climate change (Plan International). COP26 is a critical opportunity for world leaders to work in partnership with youth and youth-led organizations to target the connections, particularly through the review and enhancement of the Doha Work Programme on Action for Climate Empowerment. Targeting the Connections will bring together youth activists with world leaders, experts and artists to share experiences, priorities and solutions for building a greener, fairer future.

During the one-year MOSAiC expedition, led by the German Alfred Wegener Institute, hundreds of scientists from all over the world explored the epicentre of climate change on board a modern research icebreaker, RV Polarstern, which drifted with the ice through the Arctic Ocean. The experts investigated the fate of sea ice and the coupled ocean and atmosphere system – for the first time near the North Pole during the polar winter and using modern instruments and sensors – to provide the first-ever comprehensive assessment of the region. Scientists gathered terabytes of data on the sea ice, the atmosphere above, the ocean below, and the unique wildlife of the Arctic. They observed organisms in and underneath the ice – an ecosystem that eludes remote sensing. This unprecedented data will make it possible to represent more accurately complex interactions in the Arctic climate system. Camera teams from UFA Show & Factual accompanied the international team of climate scientists for an entire year. The 90-minute documentary takes viewers on a breath-taking and vital expedition to the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at least twice as quickly as in the rest of the world. The MOSAiC expedition set out to substantially enhance our understanding of the Arctic Ocean and Earth’s climate. The documentary is accompanied by a discussion session with climate scientists: Prof Antje Boetius and Prof Markus Rex (both Alfred Wegener Institute) and producer Phillip Grieß (UFA) will offer further insights into this extraordinary, year-long expedition and answer questions on the latest research findings and climate change.","panel":null,"film":"Film"},{"ID":"S141","Text":"Walk in Beauty: Future Dreaming through Indigenous Knowledges and Western Science","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjVMYXkEVn0","views":998,"organizer":"Groundswell Climate Collective and Emergent Diplomacy","description":"The Groundswell Climate Collective and the Center for Emergent Diplomacy are co-facilitating an interactive workshop that speaks to the skills and knowledge needed to prepare for surviving in the near-term future in harmony with our Living Systems.

Emphasising the unique experiences of their age group, the documentary features interviews, vlogs and mini films created by the young people, who also narrate. Water-related impacts are a key theme: in the UK, children talk about their experiences of flooding, while in South Africa water shortages are a major issue. Cutting across all of the experiences is the deep concern the young people share about their futures, their families, the destruction of the natural environment and climate justice. The film is a collaborative effort from a team including University of Leeds, Leeds City Council, the Yorkshire and Humber Youth Work Unit, Regional Youth Climate Assembly, the Place-based Climate Action Network, British Youth Council, and Youth@SAIIA (the South African Institute of International Affairs youth programme). It is produced by filmmaker Paul Cooke (Professor of World Cinemas at the University of Leeds) but fundamentally shaped by the young people involved. The Ripple Effect is a product of a youth summit held in April 2021 for Connecting Voices for Climate Action, organised by the University of Leeds. The summit provided the impetus for continuing the cultural exchange and the young people have worked together through a series of online workshops, as well as independently, to produce the final documentary and accompanying social media campaign. The showing will be followed by a presentation and Q&A with a group of the young filmmakers, who will share their own experiences of making the film and working internationally, and talk about what motivated them to get involved in the project and how they want to influence local, as well as global decision-makers.","panel":null,"film":"Film"},{"ID":"S102","Text":"NATURE AIN’T A LUXURY – Why Young Black & Brown People feel alienated from Nature in the UK & the West Presented by Artist & Musician Louis VI","YouTube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gWWs_DVNDo","views":811,"organizer":"Louis VI","description":"Expect a mixture of live music, film from Louis himself, talks, a diverse interactive panel of brilliant young POC Experts & Climate Activists exploring why people of colour in the UK & the West have been purposefully alienated & disconnected from the Natural world & what we’re doing about it.

The Transformative Urban Coalitions project is a joint collaboration between the United Nations University, Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), the World Resources Institute (WRI), the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), and the German Development Institute (DIE-GDI) and is funded under the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU).","panel":null,"film":"Film"},{"ID":"S213","Text":"Retro/Future ‘I am not just water.

The research has fed directly into the creation of a new audio theatre piece, Retro/Future. Looking to the future from the past, and looking at the past from the future. A cycle of life and of water. Clutha, the Goddess of the Clyde, takes us on a journey along the River Clyde to tell her story of what she has seen and where we are going. Exploring what we hope for, what we have inherited from our ancestors, and what we wanted our world to look like when our future was still ahead of us. Tron Young Company will launch Retro/Future with a short documentary film followed by an opportunity to directly address the audience, and share experiences and learning from the cultural exchange. Through ÚNA Festival, Indigenous Elders will bring to life Clutha, the Goddess of the river. They will invoke the goddess of the water, offer a \'blessing\' of the waters from their traditions, which will give both the Young Company and the Glaswegian audience an experience unlike they would have encountered before. Letters to the Earth with complement this audio-visual act by facilitating dialogue between everyone in the venue –Tron Young Company, Indigenous Elders and the audience too, encouraging them to deeply consider their hopes, dreams and fears for the future and to write and share their own Letters to the Earth.","panel":null,"film":"Film"},{"ID":"S007","Text":"Pipe Band","YouTube":null,"views":null,"organizer":"Scottish Power Pipe Band","description":"One of the world\'s leading Grade 1 pipe bands having featured as a regular prizewinner in all major competitions over several decades.

In a year of reflection, and focused on the goals of COP26, we have developed a multi-disciplinary programme of new works offering a creative response from our community of young artists at RCS - Hope Springs Eternal. Climate change, and in particular adaptation, resilience and nature, are at the forefront of this specially commissioned series. These works share how a new generation of artists can respond to what is happening in the world, and to help us understand it, question it, mourn it, celebrate it, and learn from it. Join us to enjoy a vibrant ensemble of Royal Conservatoire of Scotland guitarists performing music inspired by climate change. Each work will be performed alongside a newly commissioned film, inspired by the music, created by RCS Film students. Our performance of music and film will include works by Leo Brouwer, Eddie McGuire and Philip Glass with each work purposely reflecting the constancy of change: we can either contribute positively to evolution by harmonising with nature and working together to forge a brighter future- or stand by in placid ignorance. This performance will tour, travelling by bicycle, to small venues and schools in and around Glasgow as well as feature in the British Council-supported ‘Climate Portal’ that will act as a global portal to creativity, collaboration and conversation, connecting Scotland to the rest of the world.

SUMMARY Join us for the premiere of A Good Life 2030, a documentary exploring the link between advertising, consumption and climate change together with new adverts for 2030 created by top advertising agencies. Hear talks from the Co-Founders of Purpose Disruptors exploring the tensions people in advertising feel at this moment and the role they can play in creating new visions of the future. Ones that we can move towards together, today. DOCUMENTARY: A Good Life 2030 The documentary will show how people in the advertising industry who are the architects of desire can create desire for something different, a new ‘Good Life’. See how new research by the Insight Climate Collective reveals how UK citizens have a clear vision of A Good Life in 2030 - they dream of a life filled with connection not just consumption. Understand the shifts people in the industry think are necessary in response to this, drawn from imagination workshops with over 100 industry leaders - some of whom are featured in the documentary. Finally, see behind the scenes as top advertising agencies sprint to create ‘ads for 2030’ in response to the citizens\' visions. ADVERTS for 2030 Be the first to see the new ‘adverts’ for 2030 that create compelling visions of the future, made for COP26 and screened here for the first time. TALKS from Purpose Disruptors The films will be accompanied by talks from Lisa Merrick-Lawless and Jonathan Wise, co-founders of Purpose Disruptors and ex-industry leaders. They will share how their work is helping facilitate the change at the heart of the advertising industry and how this change is being led from within by a community of over 1,700 change agents. goodlife2030.earth #goodlife2030","panel":null,"film":"Film"},{"ID":"S110","Text":"Arctic Free","YouTube":null,"views":null,"organizer":"Parvati Foundation","description":"“Arctic Free”, a visually stunning multimedia presentation, reveals the urgency to safeguard the Arctic Ocean in its entirety for the sake of our collective survival.

The last 18 months has taught us something: that over-intellectualizing crisis after crisis in our heads is very different to experiencing it for ourselves - to feel it hitting us in our hearts, in our real lives, in our collective consciousness. This is not a time for analysis, for frameworks, for yet more theory; this is a time to dive into the emotions we are experiencing and to channel them toward creating actual change. We owe this to current and future generations. We invite you to join us for this experiential session, exploring the role creativity, design, storytelling and innovation have in facilitating emotional connections to the future. This is a COP event like no other! Drawing on the stories of Welsh communities – we want to build on our collective narrative which binds us internationally. “By telling our personal stories of challenges we have faced, choices we have made, and what we learned from the outcomes, we can inspire others and share our own wisdom. Because stories allow us to express our values not as abstract principles, but as lived experience, they have the power to move others.” - Marshall Ganz An interactive session to reflect and share diverse narratives in our response to the challenges ahead. The session will include examples of performance art from Wales, multi-media videos, and the use of storytelling. This is a personal, emotionally-resonant event on the last morning of the COP26 Summit that acts as both catalyst and convener of attendees in Glasgow, but more importantly, as a kick-off to rolling conversations that continue globally afterwards, pass from small community to small community, and small nation to small nation, building momentum and advocacy.

It is a collaboration between critically- acclaimed digital studio Fast Familiar and neuroscientist Dr Kris De Meyer. The format – a blend of interactive discussion and digital ‘storytelling’ – is novel and engaging, and has resulted in articles in The Observer and New York Times. A small group of participants take on the role of an advisory board to a North American ski conglomerate. Carefully crafted video ‘testimonies’ draw the audience into the scenario, equipping them with knowledge about the company - which, like all winter leisure providers, is severely affected by our changing climate. The participants review information and make decisions to safeguard the future of their fictional company. The activity’s bespoke control system alters the trajectory of the scenario in real time, in response to participant decisions. In a world full of uncertainty and competing values, how will they know the right thing to do? Fast Familiar have created events in this format with partners as diverse as the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, NESTA and Chatham House. Do What You Must is a unique opportunity to rehearse adaptation and resilience in the face of climate risk.

The performance takes us on a journey through the extraordinary lives of wild salmon – sentient beings who are born in rivers, traverse the oceans, and return towards the end of their lives to their birth rivers to spawn and gift forward more life. The performance explores what becomes of this awe-inspiring creature and her journey in the face of an expansive, profit-driven feedlot industry. Mueller appears on stage alongside renowned circumpolar sound poet Torgeir Vassvik and folklorist and storyteller Tiril Bryn. The storytelling unfolds alongside Vassvik’s evocative, haunting soundscape. Together we take a deep-dive into the pancultural encounter between humans and their wild and domesticated animal companions, into stories told since time immemorial, practical knowledge passed on through the generations, and wisdom carried into our time through ancient music. We encounter some of the warriors who have recently stood up in defence of traditional fishing rights and territories. And we encounter her, the sentient being. Born with a fierce determination to tune in to the speech of all things – to rain shower, lunar cycle, earth’s magnetism, algae bloom, or blue whale’s thousand-mile chant – she learns, as she matures, to think like the ocean. She becomes the ocean thinking itself within her. What is it like to be her? What is it like to be her feedlot cousin, whose life cycle is determined by the demands of a global capital market? How do we grasp that modern story of exploitation? And what clues do we find both in the wisdom of old and in contemporary science to stand up against the suffering of these present days, to unweave dysfunctional stories, and to re-story the ancient human-Earth relationship?","panel":null,"film":null},{"ID":"S208","Text":"Minga Indígena Declaration Letter for COP26 Leaders","YouTube":null,"views":null,"organizer":"Desarrollo Intercultural Chile","description":"Minga Indígena, a civil society organization born in the Andes, brings Indigenous leaders—youth and elders— from all over the world.
